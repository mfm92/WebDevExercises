			<p class="interesting-fact">This is a picture of a cat. My parents' cat
				specifically. Many other people keep these as pets too because of the
				companionship they offer. God this text feels like it was written by a
				toddler. ðŸ˜… (italicized emojis!?)</p>

			<p class="description">There are many different breeds of cats, including
				Abyssinian, Himalayan, Maine Coon, Manx, Persian, Scottish Fold, and
				Siamese, to name a few. The Cat Fanciersâ€™ Association, which is the worldâ€™s
				largest registry of pedigreed cats, recognizes about 40 distinct breeds.
				The most familiar cats are the domestic shorthair and the domestic longhair,
				which are really mixtures of different breeds. Cat breeds differ in looks,
				coat length, and other characteristics but vary relatively little in size.
				On average, only 5 to 10 pounds separate the smallest and largest domestic
				breeds of cats.
