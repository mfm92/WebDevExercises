#Rules
Move your cursor keys to move the player. Watch out that you do not collide with any bug because this will result in the loss of one life. Every player starts out with three lives. The goal is to make it past all bugs to the other side, when a new round will start.

##Gems
It's possible to pick up gems which will come in the form of colored stones. These will rack up your points count if you navigate your player into one of them. The exact number of points depends on how far you've made it into the game.
One particular gem that comes in the shape of a heart will increase your life count by one so do watch out for these.

##Rocks
The game randomly adds rocks to the playing board. It is impossible to pass over rocks so you have to circumnavigate them.

##Enemy Bugs
Each round there will be a randomly selected number (between one and four) bugs that your player will have to dodge. With each round their speed picks up. If you do collide with an enemy your player will be reset to its original position and your life count decreases by one. The game will be over once you run out of lives entirely.

##Hello from the other side...
You will collect a bonus by successfully crossing to the safe shore. This bonus will be higher the further you make it into the game. The exact number of won points also depends on the number of enemies present in the current round.

##Penalties
You can't take infinite amount of time! After a certain number of seconds your points count will suffer so try to be quick. ðŸ˜‰
