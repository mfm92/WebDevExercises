                <strong>Describe a time you experienced a challenge while building a product/project and how you overcame it.</strong>
                <p>
									<em>
									At university one particularly demanding project I was assigned to work on was crafting a compiler for a simplified subset of C that is capable of compiling itself.
									</em>
								</p>
                <p>
                  <em>
										Me and my teammate's code has already grown to a 5000 lines big mess (this particular subset of C did not include linking so everything had to be packed into one file) and the solution to fixing the final bug to achieve self compilation was removing a set of round brackets in two places of the code. This bug had me searching for it nearly 20 hours a day for almost an entire week.
									</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>
										Finally spotting and fixing it definitely felt great, like a massive weight off my shoulders and gave me the motivation that pushing through tough problems pays off.
									</em>
                </p>
                <strong>What are the qualities you most desire in a work environment and/or manager?</strong>
                <p>
                	<em>
										The best managers are those who motivate you to become better at your own job. They are here for help but will also assign projects to you that help you grow and become a better developer.
									</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                	<em>
										I also like it when my coworkers have more experience than me (at the beginning of my career that is) because that lets me learn from that. Additionally I just want to get along greatly with my coworkers as this has great positive impact on my motivation.
									</em>
                </p>
                <strong>If you could master any one technology, language or framework this upcoming year, what would that be and why?</strong>
                <p>
                	<em>
										Javascript. Because ubiquity.
									</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                	<em>
										Note that the question says "master" and while I do know some things about JS already, I am far away from being a master at it.
									</em>
                <p>
                	<em>
										I'd also like to improve my skills at the MEAN stack.
									</em>
                </p>
                <strong>What do you enjoy most about web development?</strong>
                <p>
                  <em>
										Being able to compile a great product for customers. Creating an amazing user experience.
