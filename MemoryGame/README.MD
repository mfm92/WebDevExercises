# Memory Game
This is a single-page application which models the memory game. The user clicks on two cards which will remain flipped over if the images associated with these two cards match. In the other case, the cards will be flipped over again. The game continues until all cards have been flipped over.

## Running the app

Open this link:
`https://rawgit.com/mfm92/WebDevExercises/master/MemoryGame/index.html`

You start the game by clicking on one of the 16 displayed gray boxes for the first time.

## Dependencies

No additional installations or downloads necessary. The application will run by opening the link above.

## Known issues

The images might not load immediately upon opening the application if using any browser other than Chrome or Firefox.

## What are these images?!

These are logos of selected football clubs in Austria. Chances are you've never seen them before. Chances are you'll never see them again unless one of them wins the Champions League... in which case hell has officially frozen over.
