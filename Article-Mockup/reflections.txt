You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

* What new skills have you learnt?
I have learnt how to format text in HTML and include images and combine those skills to create a nice looking article. Additionally I learnt to be able to research external sources such as the MDN to find solutions to my problems at hand.

* What has been easy?
The index.html that was offered as a template has made it a lot easier for me to fulfill the task. It was basically just me adding in a bunch of tags and attributes wherever required. I thought that making sure that all tags are properly nested could pose a challenge, but apparently not. Maybe with more complicated HTML trees.

* What has been difficult?
Not difficult, but the one thing where I had to spend a minute or two was getting the superscript right. I initially thought I had to come up with some kind of cite (or blockquote or q tag for this), only to find out these donâ€™t render to anything special in any browsers. Anyway then I remembered the tip to look into the <sup> tag in the Mozilla Developer Resources. Another difficulty was verifying that my created index.html file renders to precisely the same as can be seen in the mockup pdf.

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
Trying to stay focused and not trying to come up with dozens of possible solutions at the same time.
As well as using the internet/Google to look into solutions for tasks where I cannot come up with a solution otherwise.
