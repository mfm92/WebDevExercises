## About the app / Third-party APIs

* Specify a text in the input element at the top left. Only those POIs where the name starts with the text of the input will be shown, both in the side bar on the left and in the map.
* Click on each marker and you will be displayed information about that specific POI on Wikipedia (German wiki, as many of these places do not have English Wikipedia articles).
* Click on ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ to add all currently selected POIs that are not yet added as favorites... as favorites. Clicking on
